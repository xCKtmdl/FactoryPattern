I read http://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/factory_pattern.htm
 for how to implement a Factory Pattern in Java.
 
I decided there was no reflection abuse so decided to write one that reads
 class mappings from a config file which is more like the concept I'm
 familiar with when I think of "class factory".
